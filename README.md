To download the files and run the website remotely, 
the following steps can be taken: 

- Download and Install XAmpp (to host a local server) 
- A text editor (eg: Sublime text) would be great to change any code (based on user preferences) 
- phpmyadmin has to be configured with the databases that are shown in the *phpmyadmin-databases.png* file (managerdb, properties, ratings, registration, reser, testdatabase). 
- URL to access phpmyadmin: http://localhost/phpmyadmin
- In each database, the tables would have to be created as shown in *database tables.png* file. 
- The *sql* folder contains the SQL dump of all these files, which can be run (alternatively to the previous step) 


If Xampp is used to host the remote server, the files would have to be stored in *XAmpp\htdocs\phpmysql* 
# NOTE: All the files would have to be under the same directory and not in folders, in the given path. 

Open your web-browser and type this URL: http://localhost/phpmysql/index1.php to start!
